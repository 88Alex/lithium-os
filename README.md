Lithium-OS
==========

A simple 32-bit console-based operating system.

"Lithium-OS is a lot like the element lithium- it's really light-weight and very cool-looking. Only it doesn't oxidize your computer in seconds."

  -Alexander Kitaev, lead developer

Lithium-OS features an elegant command-line interface, as well as a cooperative-multitasking system.
Support for GUIs is not planned- YET!
